Yeah\nBeen waiting for your call every night\nBut I can't wait no more\nDialing you-u-u, sorry, darling, you\n\nYou know without you, I'm so lonely\nWhen you're not here, 9-1-1 calling\nInto your heat again, I'm diving\nDarling, you, darling, you, baby\nYou know without you, I'm so lonely\nIf you won't be here, 9-1-1 calling\nFalling to you, I'm always diving\nDarling, you, darling, you, baby\n\nDarling, with me under the sun\nI know that you're my one\nI don't wanna let you go\nI can't think of being alone\nWhat am I supposed to do?\nAnd I gotta let you know\nYou got my heart like it's yours\nDon't wanna say goodbye\n\n(If you know this)\nI want to know our problem, blood type or DNA\n(If you know this)\nFriends see my feed and worry, do you, babe? Yeah\nBeen waiting for your call every night\nBut I can't wait no more\nDialing you-u-u, sorry, darling, you\n\nYou know without you, I'm so lonely\nWhen you're not here, 911 calling\nInto your heat again, I'm diving\nDarling, you, darling, you, baby\nYou know without you, I'm so lonely\nIf you won't be here, 911 calling\nFalling to you, I'm always diving\nDarling, you, darling, you\n\nI see you, you see me\nI care for you, you care for me\nWe can be all we need\nPromise I won't take you for granted, never\nI'ma treat you better (I'ma treat you better)\nI'ma see you better (I'ma see you better)\nSo honey, now come into my arms, yeah\nKiss me, baby\nKiss me, baby\n\nYou know without you, I'm so lonely\nWhen you're not here, 9-1-1 calling\nInto your heat again, I'm diving\nYou know without you, I'm so lonely\nIf you won't be here, 9-1-1 calling\nFalling to you, I'm always diving\nDarling, you, darling, you, baby",
