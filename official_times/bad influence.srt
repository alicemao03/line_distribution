1
00:00:00,173 --> 00:00:03,863
And I had time to think about it

2
00:00:03,897 --> 00:00:07,151
It’s too much bullshit that surround it

3
00:00:07,185 --> 00:00:09,217
I don’t want it at all

4
00:00:09,915 --> 00:00:12,658
But hey, I wanna have a good time

5
00:00:12,692 --> 00:00:16,172
(Good time, good time, good, good, good)

6
00:00:16,206 --> 00:00:19,891
And I had time to think about it

7
00:00:19,928 --> 00:00:23,169
But life would be so much better without it

8
00:00:23,203 --> 00:00:25,201
I don’t want it at all

9
00:00:25,863 --> 00:00:28,676
But hey, I wanna have a good time

10
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:32,108
(Good time, good time, good, good, good)

11
00:00:32,142 --> 00:00:34,145
Let’s go out (Let’s go out)

12
00:00:34,179 --> 00:00:35,140
Let’s go ‘round

13
00:00:35,174 --> 00:00:36,112

14
00:00:36,146 --> 00:00:38,188
Let’s go out (Let’s go out)

15
00:00:38,222 --> 00:00:39,119
Bust the scene

16
00:00:39,153 --> 00:00:41,929
Flip the vibe, chase the fade (chase the fade)

17
00:00:41,963 --> 00:00:46,115
And be the section everybody talkin’ bout (Talkin’ bout)

18
00:00:46,149 --> 00:00:48,272
Only fun shit is allowed

19
00:00:48,685 --> 00:00:52,650
(Bad influence, you had to do it)
An ordinary time ain’t enough for you

20
00:00:52,684 --> 00:00:56,658
(Bad influence, you had to do it)
You wanna have a good, good night

21
00:00:56,692 --> 00:01:00,661
(Bad influence, you had to do it)
It’s 4 in the morning, what the fuck we doin’?

22
00:01:00,695 --> 00:01:04,972
(Bad influence, you had to do it)
You turn and say, "a good, good time!"

23
00:01:06,176 --> 00:01:09,823
And I had time to think about it (bad influence)

24
00:01:09,857 --> 00:01:13,179

(Good time, good time, good, good, good time)
(good, good, good time)

28
00:01:24,315 --> 00:01:26,545
Sometimes you wanna luck up

29
00:01:27,891 --> 00:01:30,421
You get frustrated, call me stuck up

30
00:01:32,316 --> 00:01:34,720
But once you bring the plug up

31
00:01:36,692 --> 00:01:38,175
Makes me wanna get fucked up

32
00:01:38,209 --> 00:01:40,136
Let’s go out (Let’s go out)

33
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:41,096
