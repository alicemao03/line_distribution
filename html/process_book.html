            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>The goal of this project is to visualize the line distribution of the 13-member K-Pop boy group SEVENTEEN
                (SVT).
            </p>

        <div class="mb-4">
            <h1>Matching lyrics to members</h1>
            <p>The first step was to find who sings which parts. <a href="colorcodedlyrics.com">colorcodedlyrics.com</a>
                is community-driven repository of Kpop songs and their lyrics and which member is singing it. I utilized
                the python library <b>Beautiful Soup</b> to scrape each of the SVT songs. However, because the site
                relies on diverse contributors, the data lacked a standardized schema. This presented a significant
                data-cleaning challenge. I had to develop a normalization logic to reconcile different style guides,
                standardize member aliases, and filter out non-lyrical metadata to ensure a consistent dataset across
                all tracks.
            </p>

        <div class="mb-4">
            <h1>Finding the timestamps</h1>
            <p>
                The next step was finding the timestamp for when each line occurs. Some of the official music videos
                have close captions (CC), so with <a href="https://downsub.com/">downsub.com</a> I was able to get the
                precise start and ending timestamps for each line. For the songs that did not have available
                CCs, I use the open-sourced <a href="https://lrclib.net/">LRCLIB</a> which provided the start times for
                each line. However, since it did not provide end times, I just used when the next line appears as the
                end of current line. This isn't as accurate and a further implementation of this project would be to
                update to correct end times.

        <div class="mb-4">
            <h1>Merging it all together</h1>
            <p>
                The hardest part was merging the color coded lyrics and the timestamp lyrics together. Since the format
                of both lyrics were different it was often the case that adlibs or shortened apprebiations would occur
                in one set of lyrics and not the other. I used a two-pointer approach to merge the lines together and
                used FuzzyWuzzy to determine matching lines. The results would the be writen to a JSON file in the
                /json/songs file of this repo.

        <div class="mb-4">
            <h1>Rendering it on html</h1>
            <p>
                Finally, using D3.js, I was able to visualize the line distributions for each song for each member. The
                home page is a display of each song. Clicking on the song can also give you a more indept comparsion
                between members.
